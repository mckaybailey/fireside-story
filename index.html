        <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
        <p>A great beast of a whore breached the horizon this gluttonous night.</p>
        <p>A large sillowet of an axe obscures the moon</p>
        <p>"Behold, it is I, your vanquisher, McKay the Lard!"</p>
        <p>the unassumingly evil cake will soon meet its end</p>
        <p>The cake shudders. It had heard of this creature before, but though it only to be a myth.</p>
        <p>razors propell from the cake like swords shot from a cannon</p>
